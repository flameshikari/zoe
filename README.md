ZeroTier One with lightweight UI in a single container.

[zyclonite/zerotier-docker](https://github.com/zyclonite/zerotier-docker) used as a base image with [mokeyish/zerotier-edge](https://github.com/mokeyish/zerotier-edge) binary included. Available for amd64, arm64, arm/v7 and arm/v6 (honestly did not tested any ARM archs).

All kudos to [zyclonite](https://github.com/zyclonite) and [mokeyish](https://github.com/mokeyish)!
